            "1. The Fritzl case emerged in 2008 when a woman named Elisabeth Fritzl (born 6 April 1966) informed investigators in the city of Amstetten, Lower Austria, that she had been held captive for 24 years by her father, Josef Fritzl (born 9 April 1935). Fritzl had assaulted, sexually abused, and raped his daughter countless times during her imprisonment inside a concealed area in the cellar of the family home. \n",
            "The incestuous rapes resulted in the birth of seven children. Three remained in captivity with their mother; one died shortly after birth and was cremated by Fritzl; and the other three were brought up in the family home upstairs by Fritzl and his wife Rosemarie, after Fritzl convinced her and the authorities that they were foundlings. \n",
            "Fritzl was arrested on counts of rape, false imprisonment, murder by negligence, and incest by Austrian police one week after Elisabeth's eldest daughter, Kerstin, fell ill in the cellar and was taken to the hospital by Fritzl himself. In March 2009, Fritzl pleaded guilty to all counts and was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n",

            "Josef Fritzl (now known as Mayrhoff) was born on 9 April 1935, in Amstetten, Lower Austria, to Josef Sr. and Maria (née Nenning) Fritzl. Josef Jr grew up as an only child raised solely by his working mother, whom he alleges regularly subjected him to physical and emotional abuse throughout his childhood. The father, Josef Sr., a severe alcoholic, deserted the family when Josef Jr. was four years old and never again came into contact with him. The father later fought as a soldier in the Wehrmacht during World War II and was killed in action in 1944. Josef Sr.'s name appears on a memorial plaque in Amstetten. \n",
            "In 1956, aged 21, Josef Fritzl Jr. married 17-year-old Rosemarie (born 23 September 1939), with whom he had three sons and four daughters, including Elisabeth, who was born on 6 April 1966. Fritzl reportedly began sexually abusing Elisabeth in 1977, when she was aged 11.\n",
            "After completing his education at an HTL Technical College with a qualification in electrical engineering, Fritzl obtained a job at Voestalpine in Linz. From 1969 until 1971, he held a job in a construction-material firm in Amstetten. Later, he became a technical equipment salesman, travelling throughout Austria. Fritzl retired from active employment when he turned 60 in 1995, but continued some commercial activities. In addition to his apartment building in Amstetten, he rented out several other properties. In 1972, Fritzl purchased a guesthouse and an adjacent campsite at Lake Mondsee, managing the property, together with his wife, until 1996.\n",

            "In 1967, Fritzl broke into the Linz home of a 24-year-old nurse while her husband was away and raped her while holding a knife to her throat, threatening to kill her if she screamed. According to an annual report for 1967 and a press release of the same year, he was also named as a suspect in a case of attempted rape of a 21-year-old woman and was known for indecent exposure. Fritzl was arrested and served twelve months of an eighteen-month prison sentence. \n",
            "In accordance with Austrian law, Fritzl's criminal record was expunged after fifteen years. As a result, more than 25 years later, the local social service authorities did not discover his criminal history when he applied to adopt and/or foster Elisabeth's children.\n",

            "On 12 November 1986, at 6:40 a.m., 17-year-old Martina Claudia Posch left her home in Vöcklabruck, Upper Austria, to reach a nearby bus stop. When she did not show up for an agreed meeting with her boyfriend at around 5 p.m., the boyfriend called Posch's mother, who had assumed her daughter was already with him. She later learned that Posch had not shown up for work that day. Authorities soon determined through witness statements that she had not been on the bus that morning either. \n",

            "2. The Holocaust (  HOL-ə-kawst), known in Hebrew as the Shoah (  SHOH-ə; Hebrew: שּׁוֹאָה, romanized: Shoah, IPA: [ʃoˈʔa], lit. 'Catastrophe') or HaShoah (Hebrew: הַשּׁוֹאָה, romanized: HaShoah), was the genocide of European Jews during World War II. From 1941 to 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews across German-occupied Europe, around two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population. The murders were committed primarily through mass shootings across Eastern Europe and poison gas chambers in extermination camps, chiefly Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, and Chełmno in occupied Poland. Separate Nazi persecutions killed millions of other non-Jewish civilians and prisoners of war (POWs); the term Holocaust is sometimes used to  include the murder and persecution of non-Jewish groups.\n",
            "The Nazis developed their ideology based on racism and pursuit of \"living space\", and seized power in early 1933. Meant to force all German Jews to emigrate, regardless of means, the regime passed anti-Jewish laws, encouraged harassment, and orchestrated a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht in November 1938. After Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939, occupation authorities began to establish ghettos to segregate Jews. Following the June 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, 1.5 to 2 million Jews were shot by German forces and local collaborators. By early 1942, the Nazis decided to murder all Jews in Europe. Victims were deported to extermination camps where those who had survived the trip were killed with poisonous gas, while others were sent to forced labor camps where many died from starvation, abuse, exhaustion, or being used as test subjects in experiments. Property belonging to murdered Jews was redistributed to the German occupiers and other non-Jews. Although the majority of Holocaust victims died in 1942, the killing continued until the end of the war in May 1945.\n",
            "Many Jewish survivors emigrated out of Europe after the war. A few Holocaust perpetrators faced criminal trials. Billions of dollars in reparations have been paid, although falling short of the Jews' losses. The Holocaust has also been commemorated in museums, memorials, and culture. It has become central to Western historical consciousness as a symbol of the ultimate human evil.\n",

            "The term holocaust, derived from a Greek word meaning 'burnt offering', was an ordinary English word for centuries also meaning 'destruction or sacrifice by fire' or, figuratively, 'massacre'. During the 1950s, it started to become a proper noun and the most common word used to describe the Nazi extermination of Jews in English and many other languages.\n",
            "The term Holocaust is sometimes used to refer to the persecution of other groups that the Nazis targeted, especially those targeted on a biological basis, in particular the Roma and Sinti, as well as Soviet prisoners of war and Polish and Soviet civilians. All of these groups, however, were targeted for different reasons. By the 1970s, the adjective Jewish was dropped as redundant and Holocaust, now capitalized, became the default term for the destruction of European Jews. The Hebrew word Shoah ('catastrophic destruction') exclusively refers to Jewish victims. The perpetrators used the phrase \"Final Solution\" as a euphemism for their genocide of Jews.\n",

            "Jews have lived in Europe for more than two thousand years. Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, Jews were subjected to antisemitism based on Christian theology, which blamed them for killing Jesus. In the nineteenth century many European countries granted full citizenship rights to Jews in hopes that they would assimilate. By the early twentieth century, most Jews in central and western Europe were well integrated into society, while in eastern Europe, where emancipation had arrived later, many Jews continued to live in small towns, spoke Yiddish, and practiced Orthodox Judaism.
